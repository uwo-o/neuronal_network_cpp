### TO-DO List

| 🟢 : Ready | 🔵 : In progress | ⚪️ : To-do

---

🟢  Create basic maths algorithms and classes.

🟢 Create basic neuronal network.

🔵 Implement backpropagation algorithm.

- 🟢 Implement gradient descent algorithm.
- 🟢 Implement feedforward algorithm.
- 🟢 Use the backpropagation algorithm to train the network.
- 🔵 Check issues in the algorithms and solve them.

⚪️ Paralellize with kokos Kokkos.

⚪️ Paralellize with CUDA.

### Build

Before to build the project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [C++ Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Google Test](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13513905/how-to-set-up-googletest-as-a-shared-library-on-linux) - Guide to install Google Test on Linux

Go to `build` folder, and run the following commands:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

Then at the same folder you will find the executable file `nnc`.
